## Getting the ball rolling. i love git ##
Just wanted to get something rolling and give everyone access to it. Feel free to use this or implement something different. Simply just wanted to get the ball rolling.

## Structure ##
The structure is simple and makes use of Grunt and SASS, along with HTML5Boilerplate philosphies. You'll need to update your package.json to open the correct location in your browser after running 'grun start'. Clone the repo, run 'npm install', run 'grunt start'. 

## So far ##
We have a very simple HTML/CSS/JS structure setup, mobile first, with icons on the home page to choose from and a side settings menu that slides in and out..
